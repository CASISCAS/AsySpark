# asyspark
## Spark
Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
## asySpark
AsySpark is an component of spark, this component can make machine learning work more efficient with a asynchronous computing model.such as asynchronous stochastic gradient descent.
